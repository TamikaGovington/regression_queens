****Overview****
We have been tasked with building a machine learning model for the government of Spain, to predict the shortfall between energy generated by fossil fuels and energy generated with renewable sources. Using the programming language, Python & supervised machine learning techniques we were able to accomplish our predictions.The steps we used to reach our end results were as follows:

1.EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)-
 The data was thoroughly analysed and explored to reveal insights, patterns, correlation, etc.

2.Clean and Augment Data-
 The insights gained in phase one were used to guide the data augmentation and data cleaning phases

3.Create and Compare ML Models-
Various ML models were be created, fitted and compared to ultimately arrive at the best model for this specific task.

4. Discussion and Export-
The model performance was then assessed and the final model was chosen. This model was then used to generate predictions for the Kaggle submission.

5. Model Deployment-
An (API) Application Programming Interface was created to provide a standardised way for other individuals to interact with the built model. 

NOW, our model is available to our friends, workplace, future clients, and essentially the world at large!
